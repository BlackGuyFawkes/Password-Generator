# Password-Generator
A password generator built with Reactjs. It can generate passwords up to 20 characters in length, with a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols and numbers. 

I plan on adding more functionalites later if I have time.

This is a link to a deployed version of the program on netlify:
